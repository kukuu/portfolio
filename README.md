https://digital-twin-v2-chi.vercel.app/ .

A virtual representation of a physical Energy Meter Reader.The software mirrors the real-world physical entity by continuously collecting and emitting data at run-time from sensors, IoT devices, and other sources. It leverages advanced emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive maintenance and analytics, and simulates various scenarios and predict future outcomes. Digital twins are adaptable for use and can be simulated for use in all aspects of industry. Namely, digital transformation, eCommerce, defence, aerospace, combat systems, manufacturing, electronics, automotives, utilities and many more.

Used in combat systems, digital twins integrates advanced data analytics, real-time simulation, and AI to create a virtual representation of defence assets, systems, and operations, allowing for enhanced decision-making, predictive maintenance, and operational efficiency. By leveraging this technology, it optimises asset management, improve system reliability, and strengthen mission readiness while minimising costs and risks in complex defence environments.
